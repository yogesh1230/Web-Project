  		<h2>About me:</h2>
  		<br>
  		<p>
  		      <br>
  		      I am Yogesh Niroula, currently studying in Bsc. Computing in NAMI Collage. I am l4 student.My permanet adderess is Itahari-5, Sunsari,Nepal. I cleared my schooling form Sacred Heart English School, Itahari-5, Sunsari, Nepal. As well as i've completed my +2 career from United Acadamy, Kumaripati, Lalitpur, Nepal. My professional aspiration is below.
  	</p>
  		<br>
  		<p><b>Professional Aspiration:</b></p>
  		<p>I’m confident that every  human  has a plan for life, part of which is a career plan. Most of us spend more than half of our lives working.
  		Some of my aspirations are listed below</p>
  		<p>
  			<u><i>Dreams of Management:</i></u>
  		</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>
  			For many people, a move from a staff worker to a job in management is a major aspiration. Moving into management allows you to become more creative, take on more responsibility and earn more money.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			<u><i>Certification Goals:</i></u>
  		</p>
		<p>
			Some professions offer people the opportunity to earn status,live a wealthy life, recognition, increased responsibilities and more pay through certification. Create a certification plan, using your vacation days, savings or employer support to become certified.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u><i>Being Your Own Boss:</i></u>
		</p>
		<p>
			For many people, the chance to own a business is the ultimate aspiration. A business owner will controls all aspects of the company and doesn’t have to deal with the frustration of working for superiors who don’t share the vision.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u><i>Becoming a Consultant:</i></u>
		</p>
		<p>
			some people enjoy the challenge of building and fixing things, rather than maintaining them. Becoming an expert in a particular field lets you offer your skills as a consultant. Depending on the area of expertise, you can help the companies to improve their financial management, human resources activities, information technology systems and in many more fields.
